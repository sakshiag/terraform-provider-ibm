# ibm\_container_cluster


Import the details of a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_container_cluster" "cluster_foo" {
  cluster_name_id = "FOO"
  org_guid        = "test"
  space_guid      = "test_space"
  account_guid    = "test_acc"
  region          = "eu-de"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cluster_name_id` - (Required, string) The name or ID of the cluster.
* `org_guid` - (Optional, string) The GUID for the IBM Cloud organization associated with the cluster. You can retrieve the value from the `ibm_org` data source or by running the `bx iam orgs --guid` command in the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html#getting-started).
* `space_guid` - (Optional, string) The GUID for the IBM Cloud space associated with the cluster. You can retrieve the value from the `ibm_space` data source or by running the `bx iam space <space-name> --guid` command in the IBM Cloud CLI.
* `account_guid` - (Optional, string) The GUID for the IBM Cloud account associated with the cluster. You can retrieve the value from the `ibm_account` data source or by running the `bx iam accounts` command in the IBM Cloud CLI.
* `region` - (Optional, string) The region where the cluster is provisioned. If the region is not specified it will be defaulted to provider region(BM_REGION/BLUEMIX_REGION). To get the list of supported regions please access this [link](https://containers.bluemix.net/v1/regions) and use the alias.
