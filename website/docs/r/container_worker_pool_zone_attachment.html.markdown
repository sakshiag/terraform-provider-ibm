resource "ibm_container_worker_pool_zone_attachment" "test_zone" {
  cluster         = "my_cluster"
  worker_pool     = "my_cluster_pool"
  zone            = "dal12"
  private_vlan_id = "2320267"
  public_vlan_id  = "2320265"
  region          = "eu-de"

  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
      create = "90m"
      update = "3h"
