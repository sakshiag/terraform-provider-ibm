  Manages IBM Load Balancer.
---

# ibm\_lb

Provides a resource for local load balancers. This allows local load balancers to be created, updated, and deleted.

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create a local load balancer:

```hcl
resource "ibm_lb" "test_lb_local" {
  connections = 1500
  datacenter  = "tok02"
  ha_enabled  = false
  dedicated   = false

  //User can increase timeouts
  timeouts {
    create = "45m"
  }
}
```

## Timeouts

ibm_subnet provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

* `create` - (Default 30 minutes) Used for Creating Instance.


## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `connections` - (Required, integer) The number of connections for the local load balancer. Only incremental upgrade is supported . For downgrade, please open the softlayer support ticket.
* `datacenter` - (Required, string) The data center for the local load balancer.
* `ha_enabled` - (Required, boolean) Specifies whether the local load balancer must be HA-enabled.
* `security_certificate_id` - (Optional, integer) The ID of the security certificate associated with the local load balancer.
* `dedicated` - (Optional, boolean) Specifies whether the local load balancer must be dedicated. The default value is `false`.
* `ssl_offload` - (Optional, boolean) Specifies the local load balancer ssl offload. If `true` start SSL acceleration on all SSL virtual services (those with a type of HTTPS). This action should be taken only after configuring an SSL certificate for the virtual IP. If `false` stop SSL acceleration on all SSL virtual services (those with a type of HTTPS). The default value is `false`.
* `tags` - (Optional, array of strings) Tags associated with the local load balancer instance.
  **NOTE**: `Tags` are managed locally and not stored on the IBM Cloud service endpoint at this moment.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique identifier of the local load balancer.
* `hostname` - The host name of the local load balancer.
* `ip_address` - The IP address of the local load balancer.
* `subnet_id` - The unique identifier of the subnet associated with the local load balancer.
* `ssl_enabled` - The status of whether the local load balancer provides SSL capability.
