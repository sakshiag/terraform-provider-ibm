## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.1+
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.9 (to build the provider plugin)

## Building The Provider

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm`

```sh
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/IBM-Cloud; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/IBM-Cloud
git clone git@github.com:IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm
make build
```

## Docker Image For The Provider

You can also pull the docker image for the ibmcloud terraform provider :

```sh
docker pull ibmterraform/terraform-provider-ibm-docker
```

## Using the provider

See the [IBM Provider documentation](https://ibm-cloud.github.io/tf-ibm-docs/) to get started using the IBM provider.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.8+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
make build
...
$GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-ibm
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
make testacc
```
In order to run a particular Acceptance test, export the variable `TESTARGS`. For example

```sh
export TESTARGS="-run TestAccIBMNetworkVlan_Basic"
```
Issuing `make testacc` will now run the testcase with names matching `TestAccIBMNetworkVlan_Basic`. This particular testcase is present in
`ibm/resource_ibm_network_vlan_test.go`

You will also need to export the following environment variables for running the Acceptance tests.
* `BM_API_KEY`- The Bluemix API Key
* `SL_API_KEY` - The SoftLayer API Key
* `SL_USERNAME` - The SoftLayer username associated with the SoftLayer API Key.

Additional environment variables may be required depending on the tests being run. Check console log for warning messages about required variables.
